Job Recommendation System Project Pitch

 Proposal

Business Understanding

In today’s rapidly evolving labor markets, it is crucial to align education and training with emerging job demands and green skills. Our project aims to develop an innovative Job Recommendation System using Glassdoor data and Stream lit, leveraging AI and machine learning to provide personalized career opportunities that align with individual skills and interests.

 Overview

Our intelligent job recommender addresses modern job-search challenges by minimizing the environmental impact of job hunts and enhancing career alignment. By extracting and analyzing data from Glassdoor, our system provides tailored job recommendations, considering factors such as job title, salary, company rating, and location. This approach not only improves job match accuracy but also supports the transition to a green and digital economy.

 Challenges

1. Alignment with Labor Market Dynamics Adapting education and training to meet the evolving needs of the labor market, especially with the rise of technology and green skills.
2. Ethical and Environmental Concerns Addressing the ethical and environmental impacts of integrating intelligent systems into education and job searching.
3. Accessibility and Quality Ensuring equitable access to quality education and job opportunities through using public data sources and user information.



 Project Pitch

Introduction

Our project aims to build a cutting-edge job recommendation system using machine learning. This system will be a game-changer in the job search process, designed to provide personalized job recommendations based on user preferences and historical job data. We leverage data scraped from Glassdoor and deploy the system on the Azure cloud platform, combined with a user-friendly Stream lit application.

Problem Statement

Finding the right job that matches one’s skills, interests, and career goals is often a time-consuming and challenging task. Job seekers face the overwhelming task of sifting through countless job postings to find the most relevant ones.

Objectives

- Develop a job recommendation system that delivers personalized job opportunities.
- Leverage machine learning to align job recommendations with users’ skills, interests, and career goals.
- Utilize various factors such as job title, salary estimate, company rating, location, and industry to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.


Data Understanding

Data Sources
Glassdoor Job-related data such as job titles, salaries, ratings, company details, and more.

Datasets 
Columns Extracted:  Job Title, Salary Estimate, Job Description, Rating, Company Name, Location, Headquarters, Size, Founded, Type of Ownership, Industry, Sector, Revenue, Competitors.

Relevance of Data
 The collected data is crucial for training the recommendation model, ensuring that it can provide accurate and relevant job suggestions.

Data Repositories
 The data will be securely stored and managed in cloud-based repositories, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

Scraping Methodology

- Data Scraping we will collect job-related data from Glassdoor using automated scraping techniques, focusing on extracting key features essential for recommendation.



 Proposed Solution

We propose a systematic approach comprising:

1. Data Scraping collecting job-related data from Glassdoor, including job titles, salaries, ratings, and company details.
2. Feature Engineering preprocessing the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. Machine Learning Techniques Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and Nearest Neighbors algorithms to match users with relevant job opportunities. The `skill extractor` component will extract skills from resumes for further analysis.
4. Stream lit Application Developing an intuitive web interface with Stream lit. Users can upload their resumes, which the application processes using machine learning models to display top job recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.
5. Model Deployment using Azure Cloud Deploying the model with Azure, including serialization, containerization, and API development, followed by integration and continuous monitoring.



 Metrics of Success

1. User Engagement Measure the number of active users and frequency of system use.
2. Recommendation Accuracy Evaluate the relevance and satisfaction of job recommendations through user feedback.
3. System Performance Track system uptime, response times, and successful deployments.
4. Environmental Impact Assess the reduction in carbon footprint associated with job searching.



 Conclusion

Our Job Recommendation System, featuring a user-friendly Stream lit application, represents a significant advancement in aligning job searches with user preferences and labor market needs. By integrating data-driven insights and accessible technology, we aim to enhance career outcomes while supporting sustainable development. This project promises to transform how individuals find job opportunities and how organizations engage with talent.
